# Sunflower

The Sunflower project is regarding building a smart flower as a house hold object which will imitate the behaviour of a sunflower by following sunlight. This is done by taking reading from a quadratic sensor system. Sensors will be set at north, south east and west and our algorithm will calculate the precise angle for the stepper motor to rotate to at the scheduled time. 
The Flower is to also take online data from an API for sunrise and sunset times in order for it to go on standby mode at sunset until sunrise.
We are also aiming for building the Flower to take the house temperature and humidity levels during certain times of the day and post them on a web app to be displayed as a visual representation. This idea could potentially be developed to storing past readings on a database in order to compare readings from different times.
